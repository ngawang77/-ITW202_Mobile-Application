    <string name="text">Global warming is the slow increase in the average temperature of the earth atmosphere.
        The earth atmosphere has always acted like a greenhouse to capture the sunâ€™s heat, ensuring that the
        earth has enjoyed temperatures that permitted the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans.
        Without our atmospheric greenhouse the earth would be very cold. https://warmheartworldwide.org/climate-change/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpLfyq5il7wIVEBsrCh0y5A6hEAAYAiAAEgKDzfD_BwE Global warming, however, is the equivalent
        of a greenhouse with high efficiency reflective glass installed the wrong way around.<br></br> <br></br>
        Ionically, the best evidence of this may come from a terrible cooling event that took place some 1,500 years
        ago. Two massive volcanic eruptions, one year after another placed so much black dust into the upper atmosphere
        that little sunlight could penetrate.Temperatures plummeted. Crops failed. People died of starvation and the
        Black Death started its march.</string>
